## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send them to me [by email](mailto:gwyneth.llewelyn@gwynethllewelyn.net), as well as any diffs/patches you have, to be included on subsequent releases.

Information about the vulnerability is _not_ to be released to a general audience; 
at least not until it was properly patched _and_ a new release was publicly published,
in which case it will be announced on (at least) the ChangeLog.
