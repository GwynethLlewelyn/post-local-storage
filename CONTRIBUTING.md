# Contributions

... are most welcome!

Mora _complex_ ones should be (preferably!) as a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.

And don't forget to (automatically) add yourself as a contributor: https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage

## Trivia

The magic I use for zipping things properly (on a Mac) is:

`zip postlocalstorage.zip -9 -x \*/.DS_Store -r gwynethllewelyn/`

I'm trying to design a workflow to make this happen automagically once a new release is pushed out.
